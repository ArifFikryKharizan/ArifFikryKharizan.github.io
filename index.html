								<h1>Hello EVERYONE! =)</h1>
								<p>My name is MUHAMMAD ARIF FIKRY BIN NOOR KHARIZAN, you can refer me as Arif or Fikry. I was born on 23rd of August 2003 which is only a few days before Malaysia's Independent day. Sadly i was not able to get that title as I was an 'early born' as told by my doctor(tough luck huh). </p>
								<p>Enough of that, Currently I am a Degree student at UTM pursuing my Network & Computer Security Degree*It's not much but it's honest work* and at the moment I am struggling to understand code such as this HTML assignment and also my Coding Assignment as I am not someone that likes code that much to be honest. But give me any Network activities you sure bet I am devouring it like a Muslim in a buffet during Ramadan.</p>
								<p>My hobbies consist of reading mangas, watching anime, play games and riding my bike. A lot of people seem to notice that I rarely go outside of my room and that is 100% correct as I like to stay in room and be a couch potato but sometimes I will go outside when I am feeling the mood to ride the corners with my Bike whom I named Essex(not to be confuse with the essex-class aircraft carrier made by USA but it's a cool ship nonetheless)</p>
								<p>There's a lot more that you can learn about me so I do suggest you go and explore my ePortfolio more. That's all, I hope you enjoy your stay!! TOODLES.</p>

								<h1>Assignment</h1>
								<h3>Website Performance Report</h3>
								<p>For our team's first Web Programming assignment, we were told to do some website performance analysis using <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=cs-CZ&pli=1">Google's Lighthouse.</a> Lighthouse to make it simple is an extension made by Google to analyze any kind of website to make sure that the website in common is user friendly and compatible  with every devices. So for our assignment we have decided to make a report on the Top Newspaper Website in Malaysia.</p>
								<p>During the assignment i was task to make a research about Berita Harian and Harian Metro which are known to be the most reliable news anchor for Malaysians. Not only i learn about the history of the reason of why the company existed, I also learn about the importance of a TRUSTWORTHY source when we want to know about the latest news around us.</p>
								<p>To be brief, most of these news website gets a B+ in their website architecture as they are lacking some features that most website that uses HTML5 but it does not hinder the users experience to an extreme level, sure the amount of ads is very intrusive but with an adblock enable, it is a rather simple website for everyone to use. 
								<p>In my opinion this assignment can a rather hit or miss for student as it was done at the early stages of our studies and seeing these ruin magic(html codes) are somehow confusing for us who are new to web programming but as we are nearing the end of this semester, the assignment did help a lot as we are now more conscious regarding our website usability and compatibility.</p>

								<p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
								<h3>Personal Website</h3>
								<p>For our second assignment, we were told to make out own personal website and host it to the Internet. I will be lying when I am saying that my shame of making this very newbie website can seen by anyone does not haunt me but well...perseverance is the key to success ass they might say. At first, I was stumped as I don't even have reference to refer to, but after searching more some reference I did have a vision at that time and well. Let's just say that vision was fully implemented in the website.</p>
								<p>Is it the best website in the section? Definitely no, but is it a website that I am proud? <b>Absolutely YES!</b> Of course after learning a lot of of web programming and learning about javascript, animations, PHP i would love to include it in my personal website but I'll just leave it as be as a momento for when I started making a website.</p>
								<p>To me, it was rather difficult at first when i wanted to make the website as it was a fight against me and my css file that does not want to cooperate no matter how hard i tried but I did get it working(somehow) and I do not dare to touch any code lines in it as it is basically a ticking time bomb. But with the help of my group mates, they're the MVP in this job as no amount of gratitude will be sufficient to give to them.</p>

								<h3>GitHub E-Portfolio</h3>
								<p>My <b>MAGNUM OPUS</b> if you can call it that, this is where I took my knowledge and made a more better website compare to my previous one and compiled all the assignment that I have done throughout this course. It's not a lot but it does fit the description of the required criteria that I need to put. throughout the whole semester, I did in fact learn a lot about web programming but there are some areas where I am not comfortable diving head first into such as PHP and SQL as I am really bad at those so this is the BEST that I can give for this humble website of mine.</p>
								<p>Of course having a proper contact section with a fully functional PHP section will be great in this website but I am already satisfied with this. We'll never know, maybe I'll update the website in the future with more features(no promises).</p>
								<p>Some may see this website and say it's the bare minimum to which I agree but I did it with my one hands and I don't think it's wrong to give credit to myself where credit is due. In the future I may expand the website more with updating all of my assignments throughout my years in UTM but let us see if time is forgiving enough to give me it in the future.</p>

								<h1>Project</h1>
								<h3>jobOnCampus</h3>
								<p>For our project in this subject, we have decided to build a website about making UTM student's life more easier with a dedicated jobOnCampus website that is build from the scratch-up. This website took everything that was bad about the in-build JobOnCampus(JoC) that is in UTM portal and revamp it with a more modern design with simple and easy interface for anyone to use.</p>
								<p>This is due to the fact that JoC is not fully utilized in out university and has been an issue with the MPP, we thought just maybe we are able contribute to solve said problem. The website is still in its infant stages and as we know, babies will eventually mature into adults thus we are still tinkering it to make sure that the website is <b>SAFE & USER-FRIENDLY</b> for students and also staffs.</p>
								<p>My part was to handle the LOGIN page of the website. I have created the options for students to SIGN IN if they already registered an account and SIGN UP for students who wishes to use this website. This page has been coded to store any data that user has inputted with a proper PHP and SQL database so we can technically say that the website is already on its final stages before its release</p>
								<p>Of course this could no have been done without my teammates, Megat, Danial and Nabil that helped this poor old me with the knowledge of a peanut and I am eternally grateful for them.</p>
