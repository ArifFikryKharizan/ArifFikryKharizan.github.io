								<h1>Hello EVERYONE! =)</h1>
								<p>My name is MUHAMMAD ARIF FIKRY BIN NOOR KHARIZAN, you can refer me as Arif or Fikry. I was born on 23rd of August 2003 which is only a few days before Malaysia's Independent day. Sadly i was not able to get that title as I was an 'early born' as told by my doctor(tough luck huh). </p>
								<p>Enough of that, Currently I am a Degree student at UTM pursuing my Network & Computer Security Degree*It's not much but it's honest work* and at the moment I am struggling to understand code such as this HTML assignment and also my Coding Assignment as I am not someone that likes code that much to be honest. But give me any Network activities you sure bet I am devouring it like a Muslim in a buffet during Ramadan.</p>
								<p>My hobbies consist of reading mangas, watching anime, play games and riding my bike. A lot of people seem to notice that I rarely go outside of my room and that is 100% correct as I like to stay in room and be a couch potato but sometimes I will go outside when I am feeling the mood to ride the corners with my Bike whom I named Essex(not to be confuse with the essex-class aircraft carrier made by USA but it's a cool ship nonetheless)</p>
								<p>There's a lot more that you can learn about me so I do suggest you go and explore my ePortfolio more. That's all, I hope you enjoy your stay!! TOODLES.</p>
